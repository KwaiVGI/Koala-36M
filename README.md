## Introduction
As visual generation technologies continue to advance, the scale of video datasets has expanded rapidly, and the quality of these datasets is critical to the performance of video generation models. We argue that **temporal splitting, detailed captions, and video quality filtering** are three key factors that determine dataset quality. However, existing datasets exhibit various limitations in these areas. To address these challenges, we introduce **Koala-36M**, a large-scale, high-quality video dataset featuring accurate temporal splitting, detailed captions, and superior video quality. The core of our approach lies in **improving the consistency between fine-grained conditions and video content.**

## Dataset

### Comparison of Koala-36M and Panda-70M

We propose a large-scale, high-quality dataset that significantly enhances the consistency between multiple conditions and video content. Koala-36M features more accurate temporal splitting, more detailed captions, and improved video filtering based on the proposed Video Training Suitability Score (VTSS).

### Comparison of Koala-36M and pervious text-video datasets
Koala-36M is a video dataset that simultaneously possesses a large number of videos (over 10M) and high-quality fine-grained captions (over 200 words).

### Compared with previous pipeline
 we propose better **splitting methods, structured caption system, training suitability assessment network and fine-grained conditioning** in red box, improving the consistency between conditions and video content.

      <td width=50% style="border: none"><small>A scuba diver is exploring a shallow coral reef underwater, observing a large shark swimming nearby. The diver, wearing a black wetsuit and fins, is seen swimming slowly and cautiously through the water, maintaining a safe distance from the shark. The scene is set in a clear, blue underwater environment with sunlight filtering through the water, illuminating the sandy seabed and the surrounding marine life. The shark moves gracefully through the water, its body undulating smoothly as it swims. The diver's movements are deliberate and slow, ensuring they do not disturb the shark. The background remains relatively static, with only minor movements from the smaller fish in the water. The overall movement is slow and steady, with the shark's direction being primarily horizontal across the frame. The main subjects are the scuba diver and the shark. The diver is positioned on the right side of the frame, wearing a black wetsuit and fins, and is seen swimming slowly and cautiously. The shark is on the left side of the frame, swimming in the same direction as the diver but at a greater distance. The shark's body is streamlined, and it moves smoothly through the water. The background consists of a sandy seabed covered with patches of green seaweed and smaller fish. The water is clear, allowing sunlight to penetrate and create a serene underwater atmosphere. The scene is set in a shallow coral reef, with the sandy bottom and marine vegetation providing a natural habitat for the marine life. The camera is stationary, providing a wide-angle view of the scene. The perspective is from the diver's point of view, capturing both the diver and the shark in the frame.<small></td>
      <td width=50% style="border: none"><small>two men in a workshop or garage setting, where one man is demonstrating how to put on a black jacket with the word "KIMM" printed on the back. The man in the black jacket is standing still while the other man, who is wearing a purple shirt, is actively pointing and gesturing to explain the process. The scene is well-lit, and the background includes shelves with various motorcycle helmets and other equipment. The main subjects are two men. The man in the black jacket is wearing a black jacket with the word "KIMM" printed on the back. He is standing still and observing the demonstration. The man in the purple shirt is actively gesturing and explaining the process of putting on the jacket. He is wearing a purple shirt, jeans, and a silver bracelet. The man in the purple shirt is actively pointing and gesturing towards the man in the black jacket, indicating specific areas of the jacket to be adjusted or fastened. His movements are deliberate and focused, with moderate amplitude and speed. The man in the black jacket remains mostly stationary, occasionally shifting his posture slightly to follow the instructions. The background remains static throughout the video. The camera is stationary, providing a medium shot that captures both men and the background clearly. The view is at eye level, focusing on the interaction between the two men.</small></td>

## Video Suitability Assessment
we develop a Video Training Suitability Score (VTSS)
that integrates multiple sub-metrics, allowing us to filter high-quality videos from
the original corpus.

To predict the VTSS of the video, you can download the checkpoint from [here](https://huggingface.co/Koala-36M/Training_Suitability_Assessment), then you can run :

```
cd training_suitability_assessment
pip install -e .
python inference.py
```
